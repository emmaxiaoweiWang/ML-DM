First lesson in Tensorflow

I guess it is beacuse the data unit in this tool is tensor and the algorithm is all about connecting these data together they name it 
tensor flow. The rank of a tensor can be more than 2. And the rank is number of dimensions of the tensor. Tensor is just an array.

Today I install it on windows using python's pip3 tool and try some scripts. A constant is also a tensor. You can create a node of a constant.
Until you create a session object and invoke the run method of session object, you can get the real value the value of the node created before.

Computational graph is composed of different nodes. Each node accepts tensors as input and output tensors. Constant is also a kind of node.

There are differences between placeholder and variables. Variabes can be initialized while placeholder is not. And variables are not initialized 
until global_variables_initializer is invoked.
